# Part 5

## Parsers

Previously we looked at `optics`, particularly `lenses`, a way of getting
information from and changing structured data.

- But what if the data isn't structured yet?

- What can we do about that?

## Validation

Just to be clear, we are not talking about validation.

```typescript
const isFine = (data: any): boolean => {
  return 'id' in data && 'name' in data
}
```

- Validation tells us something about the data, but at the end, we have no more
  idea of it's structure.

- Parsing takes us from **unstructured** to _structured_ data.

## Classic parsing

The classic pattern upon receiving external data as a string of `JSON`, is to do the following:

```typescript
const processApiStuff = (jsonStr: string): object | null => {
  try {
    // JSON.parse throws on failure because the world is unjust
    const json = JSON.parse(jsonStr)
    return json
  } catch {
    return null
  }
}
```

- (In a better world, we could inspect the error and make this more like `String -> Either MeaningfulError JSON`)

- (but I digress)

- The key thing is that at the end, we have parsed a `string` into some sort of
  `object` and thus it has gained structure.

## Refining

Libraries like `io-ts` let us further refine `object` into something more
specific if we're feeling particularly type-safe.

```typescript
import * as t from 'io-ts'

const idNameThing = t.type({
  name: t.string,
  id: t.integer,
})

type IdNameThing = t.TypeOf<typeof idNameThing>

idNameThing.decode({ id: 123, name: 'Bruce' }) // Right IdNameThing

idNameThing.decode({ id: 'Horse time', name: 123 }) // Left Error
```

- Again, we have gone from `object -> IdNameThing` and learned more about the structure

## This sounds solved then

So this is all well and good for `JSON`, but what if we want to parse structure
from any lump of string data?

- This often goes one of two ways:

- A custom function:

```typescript
const decode = (input: string): string => {
  const start = input.slice(0, 5)
  return start
}
```

- A regex: `^dog$` or `//[^\r\n]*[\r\n]`

- What if I told you there was a third way?

- And that it was _composable_?

## Parser combinators

Parser combinators, like all functional programming abstractions, is about
taking tiny `Parser`s that do so little that it feels like almost nothing, and
combining them together to make big things that are hopefully still easy-ish to
understand.

- Easier than the equivalent regex anyhow.

- And easier to maintain than any hand rolled parsing function

- So what is a `Parser` here then?

- Easy!

- A parser of _things_ is a function from **strings** to lists of pairs of **strings**
  and _things_

- By which of course, I mean:

```haskell
parser :: String -> [(String, A)]
```

- or

```typescript
type ParsingFunction<A> = (str: string) => [string, A][]
```

- It takes a `string` of something, and then returns a list of things it could
  be, each with the leftover `string`.

## Whoa now

There is a slightly simpler version which we will use today:

```typescript
type ParsingFunction<A> = (str: string) => Option<[string, A]>
```

- This takes a **string** and then returns either `None` (for "I could not
  parse this nonsense") or a `Some` with the remainder and the thing it parsed.

- We'll wrap it up like this so Typescript can keep up:

```typescript
type Parser<A> = { parse: (str: string) => Option<[string, A]> }
```

- The simplest one would be:

```typescript
anyChar :: Parser<string>
```

- This returns any single character.

```typescript
anyChar.parse('horse') // Some(["orse", "h"])
anyChar.parse('') // None
```

## Combination time

Let's say we want it to be a bit more fussy? Let's introduce our first
combinator:

```haskell
pred :: Parser A -> (A -> Boolean) -> Parser A
```

- Now we can ask for specifically capitalised letters:

```typescript
const isCapital = (char: string) => {
  const code = char.charCodeAt(0)
  return (
    code > 64 && code < 91 // upper alpha (A-Z)
  )
}

const capitalChar: Parser<string> = pred(anyChar, isCapital)

capitalChar.parse('horse') // None
capitalChar.parse('Horse') // Some(["orse", "H"])
```

- Great! How what about one for numbers?

```typescript
const isDigit = (char: string) => {
  const code = char.charCodeAt(0)
  return (
    code > 47 && code < 58 // numeric (0-9)
  )
}

const digitChar: Parser<string> = pred(anyChar, isNumber)

digitChar.parse('horse') // None
digitChar.parse('9 horses') // Some([" horses", "9"])
```

- We have a problem though, all we have now is a `string` that we know has a
  number in it?

- How do we turn `Parser<string>` into `Parser<number>`?

- .

- ..

- ...

- ....

- .....

## It's our old pal

Yes, you guessed it. It's our old friend, `map`.

```haskell
map :: (A -> B) -> Parser A -> Parser B
```

- Therefore we can make a `Parser<number>`.

```typescript
const digitParser: Parser<number> = map(digitChar, a => Number(a))

digitParser.parse('horse') // None
digitParser.parse('123') // Some(["12",3])
```

- What about parsing more than one thing?

## oneOrMore and zeroOrMore

We have more combinators for grabbing multiple things.

```haskell
zeroOrMore :: Parser A -> Parser A[]
oneOrMore  :: Parser A -> Parser A[]
```

- These keep trying the same parser until they fail and return the results

- `oneOrMore` fails if we don't get any

- whilst `zeroOrMore` will happily return an empty array

- (strictly we could define a `NonEmpty` array type and `oneOrMore` would
  become `Parser A -> Parser (NonEmpty A)`. But not today.)

- Usually we'd then `map` over the result to combine the array of characters into something more useful.

- Let's grab a pile of capital letters

```typescript
const capitalParser: Parser<string> = pred(anyChar, isCapital)

const shoutingWordParser: Parser<string> = map(
  oneOrMore(capitalParser),
  as => as.join('')
)

shoutingParser.parse('not shouting') // None
shoutingParser.parse('SHOUTING time') // Some([" time", "SHOUTING"])
```

## Trying different things

We can try one parser, and then, if it fails, another.

```haskell
alt :: Parser A -> Parser A -> Parser A
altMany :: (Parser A)[] -> Parser A
```

- `alt` takes two parsers with the same type, and tries one, and then the other

- `altMany` takes an array of parsers and keeps trying them until one works

- Let's try them with the helpful `matchLiteral` function, which is a `Parser`
  that takes a `string` and matches if it's exactly the same.

```typescript
type Animal = 'Dog' | 'Cat' | 'Horse'

const animalParser: Parser<Animal> = altMany(
  matchLiteral('Dog'),
  matchLiteral('Cat'),
  matchLiteral('Horse')
)

animalParser.parse('Bat hat') // None
animalParser.parse('Horse course') // Some<[" course", "Horse"]>
```

## More combining

Now most things we want to parse have different elements inside that we want to
access. How do we look for `X` and then `Y`?

```haskell
pair :: Parser A -> Parser B -> Parser [A,B]
```

```typescript
const animalWithPunctuation: Parser<[Animal, string]> = pair(
  animalParser,
  matchLiteral('.')
)

animalWithPunctuation.parse('Horse') // None
animalWithPunctuation.parse('Horse.') // Some<["", ["Horse","."]]>
```

- Often, we want to check elements are there, but we don't care about them, so
  we have these helpers:

```haskell
left  :: Parser A -> Parser B -> Parser A
right :: Parser A -> Parser B -> Parser B
```

```typescript
const animalParserLeft = left(animalParser, matchLiteral('.'))

animalParserLeft.parse('Horse') // None
animalParserLeft.parse('Horse.') // Some<["","Horse"]>
```

- We need the full stop to be there, but we don't want to keep it.

- Or perhaps we're incredibly interested in punctuation and nothing else

```typescript
const animalParserRight = right(animalParser, matchLiteral('.'))

animalParserRight.parse('Dog') // None
animalParserRight.parse('Dog.') // Some<["","."]>
```

## Great

That's a **LOT** of things. I am sorry.

As usual, talk is cheap, and the best way to gain an intuition to use this stuff, so let's do that.

We're going to make lots of little parsers, building up to one for _email
addresses_, and then if we're really lucky, some _meter serial numbers_.

What a time to be alive.
